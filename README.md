# HTML and JavaScript Div Styling

This simple project demonstrates how to use HTML and JavaScript to modify the styling of a `<div>` element dynamically. You can change the color, background color, margin, padding, font size, font weight, height, and width of the `<div>` element through JavaScript.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: This HTML file contains the basic structure of the webpage and includes a `<div>` element with the ID "div1."
- `script.js`: This JavaScript file is linked to the HTML page and contains the code to modify the styles of the `<div>` element.
- `README.md`: This readme file providing project documentation.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/div-styling-project.git
   ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser. You will see a simple webpage with a text inside the `<div>` element.

3. The JavaScript code in `script.js` is responsible for changing the styles of the `<div>` element. No user interaction is required. When you open the HTML file in the browser, the JavaScript code will execute automatically.

4. The following styles are applied to the `<div>` element:

   - Text color is changed to blue.
   - Background color is set to yellow.
   - Margin is added, giving the `<div>` a 20px margin.
   - Padding is added, giving the `<div>` a 10px padding.
   - Font size is set to 18px.
   - Font weight is set to bold.
   - Height is set to 200px.
   - Width is set to 300px.

5. You can view the changes by opening the browser's developer tools and inspecting the `<div>` element's styles.
